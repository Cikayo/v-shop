      This item is made in international standard 925 sterling silver. Its original color is silver. In order to reach a perfect effect on design, it was plated with a layer of gold, that says, the metal for this product is not gold on its own. At present, because of the limitation of electroplating process, even though we have introduced the best electroplating technology already, the gold coat will wear and tear with your continuously wearing, and then may expose the silver color of inner metal. Please kindly notice that it's the craft characteristic, which does not belong to quality problem.
